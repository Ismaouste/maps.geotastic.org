# Vaguely Rude Place Names Map

## Gentle Introduction

The [Vaguely Rude Place Names Map](http://maps.geotastic.org/rude/) is a simple web mash up of places which, to the British sense or humour, sound vaguely rude and thus are, by definition, funny. If you're not British, it might be confusing why this is amusing.

Meanwhile, [here's a blog post](http://www.vicchi.org/2013/02/06/ooh-that-sounds-rude-mapping-british-innuendo/) which may, or may not, explain how the map came into being.
